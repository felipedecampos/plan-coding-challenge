#### Using the Code Igniter (codeigniter.com) or Laravel (laravel.com) framework build a Tic-Tac-Toe game with the following features:

- Take a name for the two players and begin a new game
- Use basic styling for the grid using css. Allow the players to click the grid to make their move, and highlight when the game is finished
- Store the results of each match in a MySQL database, and have a page to view the results

#### Use the bootstrap framework to make it responsive in the following ways:

- On mobile device, make the game full screen
- On desktop browser have the results of the last 5 matches on the right-hand side â€“ do this in bootstrap, not php
- If you have more time, then please look at making an option of playing against the computer
Once finished, please email a copy of the source code and the database structure to review. We would typically expect this to take someone 48-72 hours but please let us know if this is not possible.
